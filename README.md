# Audio Streaming App
## Stream audio input from server to a client
This project creates a stream of raw wave recorded data, between a server and a client using **PyAudio**'s bindings for **PortAudio**, a cross-platform audio I/O library.

It is required for you to have PyAudio in your machine. For an installation guide, visit [PyAudio's Documentation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/).

Run ```Client.py``` to recieve to recieve the data, and ```Server.py``` to send it.
